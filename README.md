Specifically this app was written for freefly scrambles events at https://downunder.iflyworld.com. The need to add participants to an event and quickly (re)generate teams, add participants to teams manually, display teams in a table.

Scrambles Events
-------------

- Participants fly in teams of a given size for a given number of rounds. 
- Teams are randomly generated to be unique across the rounds. (Odd number of participants per team will occur)
- Manually adding participants to a team can be done as an unscored flyer or as a scored flyer.
- View teams and participants in a table format and allow public access.
- Score participants for each round. View totals.

Contributing
